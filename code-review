I really love your project! It is clean, nicely laid out, and well organized. 
While everything is named in such a way that your code is easy to follow, I do 
wish it was a little bit more documented.

In terms of the site itself, my only comment is on the color - the bright
red-on-grey of the main landing page, while obviously a good nod to the
pokeball colors, can be a little hard on the eyes. It works very nicely,
though, on the game page itself, where the white background helps balance
it out.
